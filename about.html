        <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
        <p>
          I have developed skills such as communication and teamwork through
          group projects such as NCS (National Citizen Service), where I spent 2
          weeks engaging in group activities with my team, which helped me to
          improve my social skills. In the last 2 weeks, while assuming the role
          of Project Management Assistant, I helped my team plan and execute
          fundraisers for the homeless in Milton Keynes as well as another
          social action project aimed at helping local schools. Similarly, I
          have developed technical skills such programming and software
          engineering fundemantals during my time in sixth form and university
          as a computing student. I have worked with a group to produce the
          specification, interface layouts and the architectural designs for a
          zoo’s proposed software suite. Although we did not write any software,
          we learned some fundamentals of software engineering such as carrying
          out a series of client elicitation interviews, and other problem
          domain characteristics investigations to obtain a full description of
          the problem domain.
          <!--
          Similarly,
          working as a member of the ‘Senior Student’ team, at an academy, has
          helped me to develop leadership skills and improved my ability to
          solve problems, as I cooperated with other members to improve the
          academic experience of students by assisting them and attempting to
          resolve any issues they faced. -->
