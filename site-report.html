        <h2>Date: 6th April 2022</h2>
        <h3>Initial Commit</h3>
        <p>
          The first component of my website was the Homepage (index.html), as
          this is the page the browser displays. I created the content needed
          for the page before thinking defining the layout of the page. I used
          semantic HTML tags such as 'nav' for the navigation bar and 'main' for
          the pages main content. Then I committed the first version of my code
          and published my master branch using Visual studio’s source control
          feature to access Git and GitHub.
        </p>
        <h3>CSS Grid Layout – Homepage</h3>
        <p>
          I decided to use CSS Grid to create the layout of my page. I used a
          5-column grid on the Homepage to position the elements at specified
          locations, while allocating different widths of space.
        </p>
        <h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
        <p>
          I created a navigation bar to give users access all the sites pages
          from one location. As a result of my initial design plan, I decided to
          place the navigation bar within the site’s header. I also used the
          image of the university logo as a place holder for a potential logo.
        </p>
        <h3>Initial Background</h3>
        <p>
          Unsure of the best background to use, I decided to use a background
          image that resembled a circuit as websites and other software require
          machines to run them. Therefore, it felt relevant, and I believed it
          was a reasonable choice. After trying a couple different background, I
          settled for a white background with grey lines resembling a circuit
          board.
        </p>
        <img
          src="imgs/site-report/initial-background.png"
          alt="Image of initial page design"
          class="img-max-width"
        />
        <h3>New Branch: Portfolio Page (portfolio.html)</h3>
        <p>
          Adding a new page can be considered a major update to the site,
          especially when this new page requires different components, which
          require additional CSS rules. As a result, I decided to create an
          additional branch of code to protect the code within my master branch.
        </p>
        <h3>Interactive Images: Portfolio</h3>
        <p>
          To represent the placeholder websites, I used links and images which
          the user could click to access each site respectively. Additionally,
          to improve the sites interactivity I applied CSS rules which
          manipulate the properties of the links and images to give the user a
          greater feeling of control by responding to their actions with the
          mouse.
        </p>
        <h3>CSS Grid Layout: Portfolio Page</h3>
        <p>
          Like the homepage, I used CSS Grid to create the layout of the
          portfolio page. I used a 2-column grid to position the title of the
          page and the thumbnails/links of the placeholder websites at specified
          locations. To prevent any of the Grid rules of the different pages
          from clashing, I used CSS grid to create the layout for every page
          using the 3 main components (header, main, footer). The main tag then
          contains a specific grid rule which allows the content within the main
          of each page to possess different layouts by utilising the class
          properties of the elements within the CSS file.
        </p>
        <h3>Portfolio Page: Debugging Grid Cell Expansion Bug</h3>
        <p>
          One of the CSS rules I applied to the websites’ thumbnails causes them
          to expand when the user hovers over them using the mouse pointer.
          However, I discovered that 2 of the links to placeholder websites
          would cause other elements on the page to shift position. After
          inspecting the html and CSS properties of both elements, I concluded
          it was the CSS rule specifying the grid row height ratio, which
          created this problem. After commenting out the CSS rule the problem
          was solved. After completing the Portfolio page within the new branch,
          I merged the new changes into the master branch, which contains the
          main code.
        </p>

          class="img-proportion-16-9"
        />
        <h3>New Branch: Contact Form (contact.html)</h3>
        <p>
          Again, adding another page which required different components and
          additional CSS rules would cause my currently functional site to
          become vulnerable to errors. As a result, I decided to create an
          additional branch of code to protect the code within my master branch.
        </p>
        <h3>CSS Grid Layout: Contact Form</h3>
        <p>
          With the form element acting as the container for the content on this
          page I used CSS grid rules to layout the input fields and labels.
          Using the “mailto” function, as instructed, I designed the form to
          open the user’s client mail application once the submit button is
          selected.

        <h3>New Branch: Blog Page (blog.html)</h3>
        <p>
          To protect the functionality of my code I created a separate branch to
          develop the Blog page.
        </p>
        <h3>CSS Grid Layout: Blog</h3>
        <p>
          I used a 3-column grid layout to position the title of the page and
          the thumbnails/links of the various blog articles.
        </p>
        <h3>Blog Article</h3>
        <p>
          Using CSS grid, I created a 3-column layout for all the blog articles.

        <h3>Dark Theme</h3>
        <p>
          I decided to change the light theme of my website, as I personally
          prefer dark themed apps and sites. They are especially beneficial in
          dark environments.
        </p>
        <h3>New Branch: Animation – Shooting Stars Background</h3>
        <p>
          When deciding where to use animation, I thought of 3 options:
          background animation, profile picture animation, and animated text.
          After setting up a poll on social media for my friends to vote, I
          listened to the majority and decided on the background animation. To
          decide which animation I would use in the background, I begun
          experimenting with a few ideas. Finally, I settled for a change in the
          background colour gradient, once the user hovers over the site’s body,
          and some objects which move diagonally, in one direction, across the
          screen. This animation is intended to emulate a simplistic version of
          shooting stars in empty space, as well as portray my current skillset
          which also possesses empty space for new skills and further growth.
        </p>

        />
        <h3>Resolving Merge Conflict: Blog and Background Animation</h3>
        <p>
          Before developing the background animation branch, I had yet to merge
          the blog branch into the master branch. As a result, when I merged to
          2 branches consecutively, Visual Studio flagged some conflicting code.
          It was quite easy to resolve as I simply authorised both changes,
          since they were necessary.

        <h3>Comments: Planning Further Development</h3>
        <p>
          After reading through the CSS rules applied to the desktop version of
          the website, I decided to leave comments proposing changes to the CSS
          rules which would suit a mobile display for the website. This made it
          much easier when writing the CSS rules for the mobile view, as I had a
          clear direction and an expected outcome.

        <h3>Mobile Optimisation: Percentage Measurements</h3>
        <p>
          I changed some measurement values for grid gaps and widths for a few
          elements, which would need to remain proportional in size to the
          device screen.

        <h3>Mobile Optimisation: Navigation Bar</h3>
        <p>
          Using CSS rules in the mobile.css script, I created a mobile menu
          which is hidden initially until the user toggles its display state
          using the hamburger icon. I moved the nav bar outside of the header to
          achieve the desired effect which resulted in a change within the
          desktop display.

        />
        <h3>GitHub: Host Live Site</h3>
        <p>
          I hosted my site on GitHub to view it from my phone and to see how it
          is rendered when live.
        </p>
        <h3>Mobile Optimisation: Debugging</h3>
        <p>
          I noticed that the stars on the homepage were causing characters in
          the main to shift by expanding the grid, after using chrome’s inspect
          element function. I moved the stars out of the main container, which
          solved the problem.

        <h2>Date: 16th April 2022</h2>
        <h3>About Page</h3>
        <p>
          As the About page contains only text and the content of the main do
          not require user interaction, it was highly unlikely that developing
          the page in the master branch would generate errors. Therefore, I did
          not create a dedicated branch for this page.
